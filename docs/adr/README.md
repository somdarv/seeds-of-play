# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This folder holds **Architecture Decision Records** — short, immutable documents that capture _why_ we made a load-bearing technical decision. Once accepted, an ADR is never edited; superseded decisions get a new ADR that references the older one.

## Format

Each ADR is a single Markdown file named `NNNN-<slug>.md` where `NNNN` is a zero-padded sequence number (`0001`, `0002`, …).

```markdown
# ADR-NNNN: <Decision title>

- **Status:** Proposed | Accepted | Superseded by ADR-XXXX | Deprecated
- **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
- **Work Packet:** WP-YYYYMMDD-slug (if applicable)
- **Affected engines:** <list>

## Context

What problem are we solving? What constraints apply? Reference Brief / Build Plan / engine docs.

## Decision

The decision, stated plainly. Include the rule or pattern adopted.

## Alternatives considered

What else we looked at, and why we rejected each.

## Consequences

- Positive
- Negative
- Follow-up work / risks
```

## Pipeline integration

The Architect (Stage 4) proposes an ADR when a Work Packet introduces a new architectural pattern, a boundary change, or a cross-engine contract that doesn't already exist. The Docs Scribe (Stage 9) finalises and commits it.
