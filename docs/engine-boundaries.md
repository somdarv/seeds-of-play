# Engine Boundaries — Quick Reference

This is the canonical at-a-glance for "what each engine owns and never owns". Full rules live in `docs/engines/<engine>/`. Cross-engine effects flow **only** through versioned events in `contracts/events/` via the transactional outbox.

## Hard architectural rules (from `Build_Plan.md`)

1. No cross-schema joins. Cross-engine reads go through API contracts or projections.
2. RP mutated only via `rp_ledger` append entries.
3. Money is integer minor units (pesewas). Never floats.
4. Archive, never delete.
5. Fan Buzz has zero write access to RP / Match / Competition schemas. Deptrac-enforced.
6. Trust gates **records**; Moderation gates **public surfaces**. Never confused.
7. Outbox pattern is mandatory for any user-triggered write with cross-engine effects.
8. `Idempotency-Key` required on every user-write endpoint.
