description: Test plan and tests for a Work Packet.
---

Produce a test plan and write the tests for Work Packet ${input:wpId}.

Cover:

- Unit tests for each affected engine module.
- Contract tests against the schemas in `contracts/`.
- Integration tests across engine boundaries (events flowing via outbox).
- Edge cases from `docs/engines/<engine>/` (draw stood-ground, related-club, March transition, dispute hold, minor-protected visibility, walkover stats, etc.).
- Config-flip tests (change an admin config value, assert behaviour changes without code changes).
- Architecture lint (Deptrac / Pest Architecture) must pass.

Output the Test Plan block defined in the chat mode.
